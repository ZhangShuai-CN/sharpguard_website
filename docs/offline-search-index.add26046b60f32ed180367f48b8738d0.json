[{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nThe Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\nWhat is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\nWhat is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\nWhat is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\nWhere should I go next? Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:\nGetting Started: Get started with $project Examples: Check out some example code!

If you have already created some Examples for your project you can base Tutorials on them. This section is optional. However, remember that although you may not need this section at first, having tutorials can be useful to help your users engage with your example code, especially if there are aspects that need more explanation than you can easily provide in code comments.\n","categories":"","description":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.","excerpt":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.","ref":"/docs/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":" These basic sample guidelines assume that your Docsy site is deployed using Netlify and your files are stored in GitHub. You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\nWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to understand and successfully use your project.\nFor large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them don’t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the Docsy User Guide, which lives in the Docsy theme repo if you’d like to copy its docs section.\nOther content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the About and Community pages.\nFind out how to use the Docsy theme in the Docsy User Guide. You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in Organizing Your Content.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nTo see the documentation for other versions of Stroom click the version drop-down at the top of the screen.\nNote Check system …","ref":"/zh-cn/docs/","tags":"","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/placeholders/","tags":"","title":"Placeholders"},{"body":" 了解更多 下载 SharpGuard 是一款高性能的开源 VPN 平台。 支持多种 VPN 隧道，如 IPSec VPN、SSL/TLS VPN、Wireguard 等。 软件定义安全 (SDS) SDS 利用 SDN（软件定义网络）来增强网络安全性。 虚拟化的安全功能可以作为 VNF 在通用硬件上运行。\n高性能 极高速的加密原语并与 kernel bypass 技术相结合，提供高速的安全网络。\n密码学完备 SharpGuard 使用最先进的加密技术，如 Noise 协议框架、Curve25519、ChaCha20、Poly1305、BLAKE2、SipHash24、HKDF。\n模块化设计 模块化的设计，可以轻松的增加新的特性。\n架构安全 SharpGuard 的架构设计易于实现并容易对其自身进行安全漏洞审计。\n可视化 流量可视化，通过仪表盘可对统计信息进行查询。\n支持的平台 新特性 请关注此网站获取最新特性更新。\n贡献 可在 GitHub 上提交 Pull Request 参与贡献。\n更多 …\n联系我们 ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" 了解更多 下载 SharpGuard 是一款高性能的开源 VPN 平台。 支持多种 VPN 隧道，如 IPSec VPN、SSL/TLS VPN、Wireguard 等。 软件定义安全 (SDS) SDS 利用 SDN（软件定义网络）来增强网络安全性。 虚拟化的安全功能可以作为 VNF 在通用硬件上运行。\n高性能 极高速的加密原语并与 kernel bypass 技术相结合，提供高速的安全网络。 …","ref":"/zh-cn/","tags":"","title":"SharpGuard"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/zh-cn/tags/","tags":"","title":"Tags"}]
